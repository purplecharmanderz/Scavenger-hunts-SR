# Scavenger-hunts-SR
just a set of saves i have made for the purpose of giving a reason to explore even if you've beat the game.

to download the saves, simply copy and paste the .sav file to C:\users\(user)\AppData\LocalLow\Monomi Park\Slime Rancher. unlike mods, this wont be removed when the game files are verified.


the first map i have ready to download has a series of 56 briar ornaments hidden around, 57 if the lab one didnt phase out of existence like it appeared to. if you have questions, you can find me on the slime rancher reddit discord or the slime rancher wiki discord.
